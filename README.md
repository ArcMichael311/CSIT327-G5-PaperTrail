"# PaperTrail

A centralized academic resource management system for CIT-U College of Computer Studies students. PaperTrail provides a platform for sharing and accessing lecture notes, digital documents, presentation slides, e-books, and interactive learning materials like quizzes and flashcards.

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a web-based application for students of the College of Computer Studies, providing a centralized hub where academic resources such as lecture notes, digital documents, presentation slides, e-books, self-made quizzes, and flashcards can be easily uploaded, shared, and accessed. By consolidating these materials into one platform, the system reduces the fragmentation of resources across multiple channels and ensures that students can quickly locate reliable content.

In addition to serving as a repository, the platform is designed to encourage collaboration and active learning. Features such as tagging, peer review, and rating will help maintain the quality and relevance of resources, while bookmarking and personalized collections will enhance study efficiency. Interactive tools like shared quizzes and flashcards will foster engagement, allowing students to test their knowledge and support one another's academic growth. Ultimately, the project seeks to improve productivity, accessibility, and collaboration in the learning process.
